                    <h2 class="article-title">L’rez degustation project: Seasons on a Plate</h2>
                    <p>This project involved designing and executing a 7-course fine-dining degustation themed “Seasons
                        on a Plate.” The menu was created for 60 guests per service over three services, with all guests
                        served simultaneously. The challenge was to balance creativity, consistency, and operational
                        feasibility at scale.</p>

                    <p>As Head Chef for this project, I was responsible for leading the development of the menu, recipes, 
                        and service workflows, as well as ensuring alignment between the kitchen and service teams. 
                        Together with my Sous chef, I structured prep timelines, briefed the team and monitored execution
                        during service to maintain consistency across all courses. The role required a lot of practical
                        decision-making, which was a first for me.</p>

                    <p>The concept focuses on expressing the characteristics of each season through produce selection,
                        cooking methods, and flavour profiles. The menu was structured to build intensity gradually
                        across seven courses. Lighter flavours and textures were placed earlier, with richer and warmer
                        dishes later in the meal. Each course was designed to feel seasonal, not just look seasonal.</p>

                    <p>The kitchen operated with 10 hot kitchen chefs and 4 pastry chefs. During the R&D process, 
                        I began to understand how different dish elements directly impact service flow. Some dishes or
                        plating elements that appeared refined proved to be overcomplicated for the service under time-pressure.
                        As a result, changes had to be made to maintain consistency. The entire menu underwent several overhauls
                        to ensure that we were producing something that was realistic and executable.</p>

                    <p>One key lesson was recognising the difference between refinement and unnecessary complexity. 
                        Not every additional component elevates a dish. In some cases, it disrupts the service flow without
                        significantly enhancing the dish. This experience shifted my focus from refining individual
                        components to designing dishes with execution and service flow in mind.</p>

                    <p>Through this project, I learned the importance of structured planning, clear communication,
                        and intentional restraint. Moving forward, I would prioritise the feasibility of execution,
                        ensuring that the complexity of dishes strengthens, rather than complicates, the overall
                        dining experience for guests.</p>
