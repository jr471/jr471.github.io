                    <p>This project involved designing and executing a 7-course fine-dining degustation themed “Seasons
                        on a Plate.” The menu was created for 60 guests per service over three services, with all guests
                        served simultaneously. The challenge was to balance creativity, consistency, and operational
                        feasibility at scale.</p>

                    <p>As Head Chef for this project, I was responsible for leading the development of the menu, recipes, 
                        and service workflows, as well as ensuring alignment between the kitchen and service teams. 
                        Together with my Sous chef, I structured prep timelines, briefed the team and monitored execution
                        during service to maintain consistency across all courses. The role required a lot of practical
                        decision-making, which was a first for me.</p>

                    <p>The concept focuses on expressing the characteristics of each season through produce selection,
                        cooking methods, and flavour profiles. The menu was structured to build intensity gradually
                        across seven courses. Lighter flavours and textures were placed earlier, with richer and warmer
                        dishes later in the meal. Each course was designed to feel seasonal, not just look seasonal.</p>

                    <p>The kitchen operated with 10 hot kitchen staff and 4 pastry chefs. To manage simultaneous
                        service, dishes were designed with plating efficiency and holding time in mind. Clear prep plans
                        and service briefings were essential to maintain consistency across services.</p>

                    <p>A key challenge was achieving fine-dining refinement while producing at high volume. Some
                        techniques were adapted or simplified to ensure consistency without compromising the concept.
                    </p>

                    <p>This project improved my ability to think beyond individual dishes and focus on the overall
                        dining experience. It reinforced the importance of planning, communication, and balancing
                        creativity with practicality. In future projects, I would better manage elements that added
                        complexity without impacting my service flow.</p>
